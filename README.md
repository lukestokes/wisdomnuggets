# Wisdom Nuggets
Playing around with interactive games for increasing wisdom.

Ideas for improvement:

* Add Ray Dalio Principles: https://www.nateliason.com/notes/principles-ray-dalio
* Add instructions for anyone to include pull requests for any chunk of wisdom nuggets they want to memorize.
* Keep track of correct answers (browser storage only or add a server-side database?)
* Track answers over time (gamify daily activity)
* Let the user tag nuggets which are hard to remember which increases the frequency they are shown

Block Chain Integration Ideas:

* Login with FIO
* Randomized rewards. Prompt to send a FIO request with a very specific code in the memo. A lot of thought has to go into this in terms of how to prevent bot attacks. Various ideas include captcha, anaylzing time between clicks, blacklisting FIO addresses which abuse the system, checking against IPs, geo-location fencing, and more.
* (?) Only allow usage via a FIO address that is paid for (integrate with the FIO address registration site)
